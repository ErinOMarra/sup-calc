# About
Built using Discord.js (More specifically, Commando framework). Can be added to any server, or in direct messages.
Useful tool for those who resell Supreme items from Canada, as prices are always displayed in USD, and doing the math of adding 30% in taxes/duties + $20 USD flat rate shipping + converting to CAD can become tedious. 

# Requirements
You must have a Discord account, and you must provide your own Discord bot token. This can all be configured at http://discordapp.com/developers

# TO DO
- [ ] Get an accurate USD to CAD exchange rate, in real time
- [ ] Select province/territory, display their respective tax rates
